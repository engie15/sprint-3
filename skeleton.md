# What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550px.  How do you think that works?

When you resize the screen to less than 550px the website will display as one easily readable column.   I can see through the developer tool and inspecting a section of the Skeleton website code that it is due to the @media enquiry min-width 550px.
