# Sprint #3 Task 1: Redesign Your Site

## What is my sites’s primary purpose?

My site’s primary purpose is to:
1. Capture my journey as I build my skills to that of an entry level web and app developer and impart my technical knowledge (as I’m learning it).
2. 	Share my highlights, rant about my lows and solutions I used to overcome them.
3. Build my web and app design portfolio to engage the interest of potential work opportunities.

## Who is my target audience?
My target audience is known and unknown contacts with potential paid web & app development opportunities following once I’ve completed studies.

Secondary audience is whanau & friends, fellow EDA students and any end user who would like to read about the musing of a wannabe Full Stack Developer.


## How do I want site visitors to interact with my site?  What experience would I like them to have?

I want visitors to have a warm and genuine interaction within 5 seconds of visiting my site.  I want to imbed a sense of genuine-ness and understanding in any work that I do.  I want any visitor to have an easy and positive experience on my site.  Where content has a realistic positivity about it which I believe will be a needed reprieve from the negativity we are expose to constantly in the media today.


## How will I build my site to support my desired user experience?

I will ensure I give focus to what and how I write – making sure I don’t take shortcuts in my content for the sake of finishing things quickly and by sharing my highs, lows, solutions and my own experiences of vulnerability that a visitor knows the reality of this experience.  I want to use clear box spacing so visually my site is easy to look at and use.   I will be selective about the images I use and try not to add to many new elements that aren’t currently used on day to day websites and if I decide to add new elements – reflect this in my content.  Communication is key.
